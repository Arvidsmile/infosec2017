The number of comparissons between N attempts is N(N-1)/2,
which is about N^2. Since there are 2^256 different outputs, 
we should expect to find a match at about the point where
N^2 = 2^256. Thus when N = 2^(256/2) = 2^128.
If we estimate 2^n as 10^(n/3), we get N = 10^(128/3). 
Given that there are 7*10^9 people on earth, we would expect
the amount of time to pass before a collision to be 
10^(128/3)/(7.5*10^9) = 1/7.5 * 10^(128/3 - 9) days.
