i came to security from cryptography and thought of the problem in 
a military like fashion most writings about security
come from this perspective and it can be summed up pretty easily
security threats are to be avoided using preventive countermeasures
this is how encryption works the threat is eavesdropping
and encryption provides the prophylactic this
could all be explained with block diagrams alice is communicating
with bob both are identified by boxes and there is a line
between them signifying the communication eve is the eavesdroppers
he also is a box and has a dotted line attached to the
communications line she is able to intercept the communication
the only way to prevent eve from learning what alice a
nd bob are talking about is through a preventive countermeasure
encryption theres no detection theres no response theres
no risk management you have to avoid the threat for decades
we have used this approach to computer security we draw boxes
around the different players and lines between them we define
different attackers eavesdroppers impersonators thieves
and their capabilities we use preventive countermeasures
like encryption and access control to avoid different threats
if we can avoid the threats weve won if we cant weve lost
imagine my surprise when i learned that the world doesnt
work this way some history from the vigenere wiki page the first
well documented description of a polyalphabetic cipher was
formulated by leon battista alberti around and used a metal
cipher disc to switch between cipher alphabets albertis
system only switched alphabets after several words and
switches were indicated by writing the letter of the corresponding
alphabet in thecipher text later in johannes trithemius in his
work poligraphia invented the tabula recta a critical component
of the vigenre cipher the trithemius cipher however only
provided a progressive rigid and predictable system for switching
between cipher alphabets what is now known as the vigenere cipher
was originally described by giovan battista bellaso in his book
la cifra del sig giovanbattista bellaso he built upon the tabula 
recta of trithemius but added a repeating countersignakey to switch 
cipher alphabets every letter whereas alberti
and trithemius used a fixed pattern of substitutions bellasos
scheme meant the pattern of substitutions could be easily
changed simply by selecting a new key keys were typically
single words or short phrases known to both parties in advance
or transmitted out of band along with the message bellasos
method thus required strong security for only the key as it
is relatively easy to secure a short keyphrase say by a
previous private conversation bellasos system was considerably
more secure blaisede vigenere published his description of a
similar but stronger auto key cipher before the court of henry
iii of france in later in the th century the invention of
bellasos cipher was misattributed to vigenere david kahn in
his book the code breakers lamented the misattribution by
saying that his tory had ignored this important contribution
and instead named a regressive and elementary cipher for him
vigenere though he had nothing to do with it the vigenere
cipher gained a reputation for being exceptionally strong
noted author and mathematician charles lutwidg edodgson lewis
carroll called the vigenere cipher unbreakable in his piece
the alphabet cipher in a childrens magazine in scientific
american described the vigenre cipher as impossible of translation
this reputation was not deserved charles babbage is known to have
broken a variant of the cipher as early as however he didnt publish
his work kasiski entirely broke the cipher and published the
technique in the th century even before this though some skilled
cryptanalysts could occasionally break the cipher in the th
century cryptographic slide rule used as a calculation aid by
the swiss army between and the vigenere cipher is simple enough
to be a field cipher if it is used in conjunction with cipher
disks the confederate states of america for example used a
brass cipher disk to implement the vigenere cipher during
the american civil war the confederacys messages were far
from secret and the union regularly cracked their messages
throughout the war the confederate leadership primarily relied
upon three keyphrases manchester bluff complete victory and
as the war came to a close come retribution gilbert vernam
tried to repair the broken cipher creating the vernam vigenere
cipher in but no matter what he did the cipher was still
vulnerable to cryptanalysis vernams work however eventually
led to the one time pad a provably unbreakable cipher
